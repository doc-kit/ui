# [2.0.0](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/compare/v1.6.0...v2.0.0) (2019-04-02)

### Features

- more updates ([#180](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/issues/180)) ([f7c5737](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/commit/f7c5737))
- release of v2.0.0 ([#191](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/issues/191)) ([77674f6](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/commit/77674f6))
- restructure components ([#185](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/issues/185)) ([91dc4d5](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/commit/91dc4d5))

### BREAKING CHANGES

v2.0.0 is considered the first stable version of Doc Kits: React and will move forward in a predictable way from this point.

- The `Playground` component has been removed due to some major flaws but will be re-added in a much better and flexible way in a future version.
- The `withStyles` HOC to override styling went through major changes under the hood. It is now stable and working correctly. Refer to the docs for correct use cases.
- Several breakpoints have been added for flexibility due to the fact that users will no longer be able to create their own breakpoints via Facepaint.
