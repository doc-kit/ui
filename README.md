## üîë Why?

It seems that more recently there has been an emphasis on documentation not only in the open-source community, but at corporate companies small and large.

In the past, documentation was very much a second-hand thought, but now, more than ever, it is increasingly important to document our systems for easier comprehension by our end users.

The React component ecosystem has given rise to full-fledged documentation engines like [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) and [Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/).

**The problem is** there has yet to be a React component library centered around documentation that can be integrated into these engines or used for custom documentation projects.

**The solution is** `@doc-kits/react` üòä

Our goal is to create documentation-related components you didn't even know you wanted!
