## Fonts

Doc Kits: React has been tested using the [Muli](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli) font from Google Fonts. Within our components we use regular (400), semi-bold (600), and bold (700) font weights.

For the best presentation of the components, we strongly recommend you use a font with these font weight variations. There are many font families that will meet this criteria. You may choose to take a look at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to find an appropriate font.

If you would like to use `Muli` directly, with the variations specified above, you can embed this link to the `<head>` of your HTML document:

**Muli**

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Muli:400,600,700"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
