## Fonts

Doc UI has been tested using the popular [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) font from Google Fonts. Within our components we use both a regular and a medium style font weight.

For the best presentation of the components, we strongly recommend you use a font with both a **400 weight** and a **600 weight**. There are many font families that have both of these weight variations available. You may choose to take a look at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to find an appropriate font.

If you would like to use `Source Sans Pro` directly, with the variations specified above, you can embed this link to the `<head>` of your HTML document:

**Source Sans Pro**

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,600"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
