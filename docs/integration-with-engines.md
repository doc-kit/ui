# Integration with Documentation Engines

The most popular documentation engines take advantage of React components by providing easy ways to integrate your own custom components to enhance your documentation.

## Docz

[Docz](https://www.docz.site/) is a popular open-source documentation engine that allows you to start writing documentation right away. It has some built-in components, but customizing your documentation [with your own components](https://www.docz.site/introduction/writing-mdx) is exactly what Docz was built for.

That means utilizing `@doc-kits/react` `in the Docz engine is simple and straight forward.

### Integrate into Docz

In one of your Docz `.mdx` files simply import the Doc Kits: React component in the same ol' fashion way.

`import { OptionList } from '@doc-kits/react';`

That is it! You can run the `docs:dev` command from Docz to see your newly integrated component live. You can see a simple integration example [here](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/tree/master/examples/docz).

## Other Documentation Engines

As long as the documentation engine has the ability to integrate React components you will be able to use Doc Kits: React.
