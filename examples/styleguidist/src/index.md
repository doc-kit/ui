The [ColorBox](https://github.com/doc-kits/react/tree/master/src/ColorBox) component is used as an example,
however, the process shown here is the same for any [Doc Kits: React](https://github.com/doc-kits/react) component.
There are several variations of integration shown to highlight the different approaches.

The examples show the following scenarios:

- Direct integration _(shown below)_
- `withStyles` HOC
- `withStyles` HOC Shorthand
- `withStyles` HOC with Props
- `styles` prop _(shown below)_
- Composing a larger component using `ColorBox` inside of it

You will find code for the variations in the `example-components` folder.
